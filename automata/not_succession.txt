DFA for formula with free variables: T U 
Initial state: 0
Accepting states: 1 2 
Rejecting states: 0 3 

Automaton has 4 states and 5 BDD-nodes
Transitions:
State 0: XX -> state 1
State 1: 0X -> state 1
State 1: 10 -> state 2
State 1: 11 -> state 3
State 2: X0 -> state 2
State 2: X1 -> state 3
State 3: XX -> state 3
A counter-example of least length (1) is:
T               X 1
U               X 1

T = {0}
U = {0}

A satisfying example of least length (0) is:
T               X 
U               X 

T = {}
U = {}
