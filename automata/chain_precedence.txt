DFA for formula with free variables: Q P 
Initial state: 0
Accepting states: 1 2 
Rejecting states: 0 3 

Automaton has 4 states and 5 BDD-nodes
Transitions:
State 0: XX -> state 1
State 1: 00 -> state 1
State 1: 01 -> state 2
State 1: 1X -> state 3
State 2: X0 -> state 1
State 2: X1 -> state 2
State 3: XX -> state 3
A counter-example of least length (1) is:
Q               X 1
P               X X

Q = {0}
P = {}

A satisfying example of least length (0) is:
Q               X 
P               X 

Q = {}
P = {}
