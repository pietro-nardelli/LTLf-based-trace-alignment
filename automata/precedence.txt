DFA for formula with free variables: J I 
Initial state: 0
Accepting states: 1 2 
Rejecting states: 0 3 

Automaton has 4 states and 6 BDD-nodes
Transitions:
State 0: XX -> state 1
State 1: 00 -> state 1
State 1: 01 -> state 2
State 1: 10 -> state 3
State 1: 11 -> state 2
State 2: XX -> state 2
State 3: XX -> state 3
A counter-example of least length (1) is:
J               X 1
I               X 0

J = {0}
I = {}

A satisfying example of least length (0) is:
J               X 
I               X 

J = {}
I = {}
