Automaton has 4 states and 7 BDD-nodes
Transitions:
State 0: XX -> state 1
State 1: 0X -> state 1
State 1: 1X -> state 2
State 2: 00 -> state 3
State 2: 01 -> state 1
State 2: 10 -> state 3
State 2: 11 -> state 2
State 3: XX -> state 3
A counter-example of least length (1) is:
N               X 1
O               X X

N = {0}
O = {}

A satisfying example of least length (0) is:
N               X 
O               X 

N = {}
O = {}
