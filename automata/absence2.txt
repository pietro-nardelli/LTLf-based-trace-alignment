DFA for formula with free variables: B 
Initial state: 0
Accepting states: 1 2 
Rejecting states: 0 3 

Automaton has 4 states and 5 BDD-nodes
Transitions:
State 0: X -> state 1
State 1: 0 -> state 1
State 1: 1 -> state 2
State 2: 0 -> state 2
State 2: 1 -> state 3
State 3: X -> state 3
A counter-example of least length (2) is:
B               X 11

B = {0,1}

A satisfying example of least length (0) is:
B               X 

B = {}
