DFA for formula with free variables: A 
Initial state: 0
Accepting states: 2 
Rejecting states: 0 1 

Automaton has 3 states and 3 BDD-nodes
Transitions:
State 0: X -> state 1
State 1: 0 -> state 1
State 1: 1 -> state 2
State 2: X -> state 2
A counter-example of least length (0) is:
A               X 

A = {}

A satisfying example of least length (1) is:
A               X 1

A = {0}
