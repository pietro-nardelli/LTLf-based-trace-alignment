DFA for formula with free variables: K L 
Initial state: 0
Accepting states: 1 
Rejecting states: 0 2 

Automaton has 3 states and 4 BDD-nodes
Transitions:
State 0: XX -> state 1
State 1: 0X -> state 1
State 1: 10 -> state 2
State 1: 11 -> state 1
State 2: X0 -> state 2
State 2: X1 -> state 1
A counter-example of least length (1) is:
K               X 1
L               X 0

K = {0}
L = {}

A satisfying example of least length (0) is:
K               X 
L               X 

K = {}
L = {}
